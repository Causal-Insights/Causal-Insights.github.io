Model:  Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview 03-25

Develop a math Web Applet that lets users visualize probability distributions.  Please consider the following things.

User can select a Probability Distribution type from the sidebar.
Include options for the following distributions: Normal, Half-Normal, Beta, Gamma, Log-Normal, Weibull, Poisson, Bernoulli, Binomial.
All the user to enter in the parameters appropriate for each distribution.
Plot the distribution
Show statistical quantities for the distributions.  Including:  Mean, Median, Expected Value, Standard Deviation (and other metrics appropriate for that distribution type).
Show the definition for the implementation of the distributions in the following statistical packages: STAN, Numpyro, Tensorflow.
Make it interactive. Use Three.js. Use JS, CSS and HTML in a single HTML file.

---

Fix the following things:
Some of the statistics are generating an error: Including the Gaussian, Gamma, Poisson and Binomial.
Label the x-y axis to provide a sense of scale.
Make a grid background for the plots.
Draw the discrete distributions using thicker lines or a bar plot.  The lines are two thin.
Make a label that shows which distribution the user selected.
Clear the previous plot when a new distribution type is selected.

Add this new feature:
When the user hovers over the plot, make a horizontal and vertical line to show the (x, y)  position of the mouse curser.
