Create a gardening web applet that lets a user build a garden box and place plants at the appropriate spacings.  Please consider the following things:

User can move line segments to design a garden box
User can drag and drop various plants into the garden box.  Each plant must be a certain distance from other plants.
Populate the plant spacings by various known spacings for various species.
Provide calculations for the amount of soils and mulch needed to properly fill the garden box.
Label each line segment with Length (Feet & Inches)
Allow for adding additional line segments.
Add plants, including zucchini, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, peppers, onions, basil, kale, rosemary, marigolds.
Show all the available plants in a single list using a name and iconography.  Keep them displayed on the side tab and allow the user to drag and drop them into place.
When the plant is placed down, keep a label for which plant is there
Do research for how much space each plant needs.
Place the recommended spacing for each plant, beside them in the side bar.  That way you know how much space each plant needs.
Have a running total of available square-footage for planting more things.  That way we know how much space is available for adding new plants.
Make it interactive. Use Three.js. Use JS, CSS and HTM in a single HTML file.

Add the following:
Create a footprint of for area occupied by each plant.  Plants areas can overlapp, but create a visual way of showing that.
Allow the user to pick-up and move a plant to a new location once it is placed.
Allow the user to delete a plant once it is placed.
Allow the user to place plants that overlap, just show it in the app.

The functionality is fantastic.  Now let's focus on the design and user experience.  Independently brainstorm and implement 3 features to improve the overall look and feel of this application.
